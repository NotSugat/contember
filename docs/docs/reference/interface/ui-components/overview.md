title: Contember UI Components
---

Contember also provides **UI Components**, which are **copied directly** into your project codebase. Rather than just offering low-level logic, these components come with **pre-built styling** (using Tailwind, Shadcn, or similar) and a standard markup structure, so you can hit the ground running with a modern, consistent look and feel.

### **Why Use UI Components?**

- **Faster Development**: You get a **turnkey** experience—just drop in a `<DataGrid>` or `<DefaultDataGrid>` and you instantly have paging, sorting, filters, and a polished table layout.
- **Consistent Styling**: Because the styling uses Tailwind + Shadcn, they slot nicely into a typical Tailwind-based workflow.
- **Complete Code Control**: These components are **not** just distributed as an npm library but are **copied** into your source. This means you can open them up, tweak the styling, rename classes, or change the structure to suit your needs—no forking or hacking around a compiled package.

Even though you get a **pre-styled** framework, you still retain **direct** code-level modifications. Whether you want to inject additional columns, alter how filters are displayed, or swap out the color palette, you can tailor everything to your project’s needs.

> **Want Deeper Flexibility?**  
> If you’d prefer to handle your **own** UI design or use a different styling approach, check out the **Headless Components** overview. Those offer the same core features (filtering, pagination, etc.) but leave every UI aspect up to you.
